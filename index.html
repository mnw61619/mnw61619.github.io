    <h2> Megan's Music! </h2>
        
	<p> My name is Megan Wright and I'm a third year Psychology major. I'm from Savannah, Georgia. A fun fact about me is that I lived in Switzerland for three years! My favorite thing to do is to listen to music. When thinking about ideas for this webpage, I decided to talk about some music that I listen to a lot! </p>
    <p> I love all kinds of music. Everything from early 1960s rock bands all the way to rap music! I definitely am not picky with my music. If you would like to see how diverse my music taste is, you can click on the link below to see my Spotify! </p>
